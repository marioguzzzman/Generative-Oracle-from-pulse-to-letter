# Generative Oracle. from pulse to letter (2014)

Generative Oracle. from pulse to letter (2014)
The Generative Oracle. from pulse to letter is a technical-symbolic interface that operates as an abstraction of oracular practices to produce enigmatic texts destined to behave as contemporary omens. The work is part of an experimental writing project that focuses on the cooperation between human and machine to experiment with writing (as a process and as a product) as well as a visualization-enunciation performance.
